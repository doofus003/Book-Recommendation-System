philosophy in the flesh,Unknown,george lakoff,philosophy,what are human beings like how is knowledge possible what is truth where do moral values come from questions like these have stood at the center of western philosophy for centuries in addressing them philosophers have made certain fundamental assumptionsthat we can know our own minds by introspection that most of our thinking about the world is literal and that reason is disembodied and universalthat are now called into question by wellestablished results of cognitive science it has been shown empirically thatmost thought is unconscious we have no direct conscious access to the mechanisms of thought and language our ideas go by too quickly and at too deep a level for us to observe them in any simple wayabstract concepts are mostly metaphorical much of the subject matter of philosopy such as the nature of time morality causation the mind and the self relies heavily on basic metaphors derived from bodily experience what is literal in our reasoning about such concepts is minimal and conceptually impoverished all the richness comes from metaphor for instance we have two mutually incompatible metaphors for time both of which represent it as movement through space in one it is a flow past us and in the other a spatial dimension we move alongmind is embodied thought requires a bodynot in the trivial sense that you need a physical brain to think with but in the profound sense that the very structure of our thoughts comes from the nature of the body nearly all of our unconscious metaphors are based on common bodily experiencesmost of the central themes of the western philosophical tradition are called into question by these findings the cartesian person with a mind wholly separate from the body does not exist the kantian person capable of moral action according to the dictates of a universal reason does not exist the phenomenological person capable of knowing his or her mind entirely through introspection alone does not exist the utilitarian person the chomskian person the poststructuralist person the computational person and the person defined by analytic philosopy all do not existthen what doeslakoff and johnson show that a philosopy responsible to the science of mind offers radically new and detailed understandings of what a person is after first describing the philosophical stance that must follow from taking cognitive science seriously they reexamine the basic concepts of the mind time causation morality and the self then they rethink a host of philosophical traditions from the classical greeks through kantian morality through modern analytic philosopy they reveal the metaphorical structure underlying each mode of thought and show how the metaphysics of each theory flows from its metaphors finally they take on two major issues of twentiethcentury philosopy how we conceive rationality and how we conceive language,0.0346811825030108,0.4134289025140247,1.2084607309843924,-0.14468045695635853

exclusion and embrace,"A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation",miroslav volf,religion,life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality otherness the simple fact of being different in some way has come to be defined as in and of itself evil miroslav volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other reaching back to the new testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our evernarrowing circle in light of this christians must learn that salvation comes not only as we are reconciled to god and not only as we learn to live with one another but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by god is there any hope of embracing our enemies of opening the door to reconciliation miroslav volf a yale university theologian has won the 2002 louisville grawemeyer award in religion for his book exclusion embrace a theological exploration of identity otherness and reconciliation abingdon 1996 volf argues that exclusion of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today he writes it may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference the issue is urgent the ghettos and battlefields throughout the worldin the living rooms in inner cities or on the mountain rangestestify indisputably to its importance a croatian by birth volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia but he readily finds other examples of cultural ethnic and racial conflict to illustrate his points and since september 11 one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife exclusion happens volf argues wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other it is easy to assume that exclusion is the problem or practice of barbarians who live over there but volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice here as well modern western societies including american society typically recite their histories as narratives of inclusion and volf celebrates the truth in these narratives but he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plots therefore such narratives of inclusion invite long and gruesome counternarratives of exclusionthe brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of native american populations come readily to mind but more current examples could also be found most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangementswhat kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference volf focuses rather on what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others in addressing the topic volf stresses the social implications of divine selfgiving the christian scriptures attest that god does not abandon the godless to their evil but gives of godself to bring them into communion we are called to do likewisewhoever our enemies and whoever we may be the divine mandate to embrace as god has embraced is summarized in pauls injunction to the romans welcome one another therefore just as christ has welcomed you romans 157 susan r garrett coordinator of the religion award said that the grawemeyer selection committee praised volfs book on many counts these included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology philosophy critical theory and feminist theory volfs focus is not on social strategies or programs but rather on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies he helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence injustice and deception garrett added that although addressed primarily to christians volfs theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity the call to embrace the other is never a call to remake the other into ones own image volfwho had just delivered a lecture on the topic of exclusion and embrace at a prayer breakfast for the united nations when the first hijacked plane hit the world trade centerwill present a lecture and receive his award in louisville during the first week of april 2002 the annual religion award which includes a cash prize of 200000 is given jointly by louisville presbyterian theological seminary and the university of

lilas child,An Inquiry Into Quality,dan glover,computers,secular faith revolves around the friendship of two men one christian and the other atheist the difference in their perspectives where faith and reason seem to diverge forms the underlying tension that propels the storyline when an unlikely sequence of fortune and misfortune seems divinely influenced and leads them to interpret events differently it produces conflicting judgments on how to react and their friendship is put to the test counteracting the wedge that pushes them apart is the human drive to grasp the spiritual meaning of existence because it is not enough to agree to disagree each is driven to bring the other to his view in order to affirm that it represents truth their actions are influenced not by a god who intervenes in the matters of mankind but by belief of whether or not he does ultimately they discover that a man is defined by his actions and not by what he believes to be true morality exists to guide actions not thoughts the story of tom dagney and christopher pierce represents the struggle between belief and nonbelief within men who by their very nature doubt that which they profess to believe and struggle to understand this dichotomy how belief translates into behavior proves far more intriguing than scholarly debate about philosophical perspectives caring about what people think pales compared to the passions aroused by how they live this story of friendship love envy tragedy and redemption gives breath to philosophy and life to the struggle to identify human purpose above all secular faith exemplifies that without a doubt a man who puts aside his faith to serve his friends will always be a better man than one who puts aside his friends to serve his faith,0.4163143726655579,-1.0109562534861352,1.0428577519635742,-0.15231760004627184
